# Higher Education Abroad (Greece)
I would like to tell you about higher education system in Greece.

Higher education, also called tertiary, third stage, is provided by Higher Educational Institutes and consists of Universities and specialist Academies, which primarily serve the military. They are mostly autonomous, but the government is responsible for their funding and the distribution of students to undergraduate programmes. Higher Education Institutions in Greece are public universities and can be attended without charge of a tuition fee, textbooks, and for the majority of students meals are also provided for free. About 25% of postgraduate programmes have free tuition, while about 30% of students are eligible to attend programmes tuition-free based on individual criteria. Each academic year is 32 weeks study programme, divided into two semesters of 16 weeks each.

According to the article 16 of the Greek constitution, private higher education is not allowed in Greece, and the government only recognizes the degree programmes offered by the public universities. Usually, most private colleges have been authorised to offer foreign undergraduate and postgraduate programmes following franchise or validation agreements with collaborating universities established in other countries, primarily in the UK, leading to degrees awarded directly by those foreign universities.
