# The cultural, geographical and economic aspects of Russia
1. I would like to tell you about cultural, geographical and econonmic aspects of Russia.
2. It is generally believed that the history of Russian culture begins in the 10th century when Kievan Rus, the first East Slavic state, adopted Christianity from the Byzantine Empire.
3. This cultural synthesis defined Russian culture for the next seven centuries.
4. In the 18th century the government of Russian Empire attempted to implement some parts of western culture in their country to shorten the development gap between Russia and European countries.
5. These changes had a painful impact on the lives of russian folks which were non-educated and could not break free from the traditions of their ancestors.
6. The next great change in culture of Russia happened in the 20th century with the overthrow of the monarchy and foundation of USSR whose ideological and political course was to provide non-religious education and science for the masses.
7. Today Russian culture goes backwards to its christianity past and becomes increasingly similar to the culture of the western capitalists powers.
8. The modern Russian state is geographically isolated.
9. It is enclosed, except in the West, by landlocked seas, deserts and mountains.
10. It is the largest self-contained state in the world whose neighbors are Finns, Estonians, Norwegians and others.
11. Russia has a complete range of mining and extractive industries producing coal, oil, gas, chemicals and metals which are exported to other countries because with the collapse of the Soviet Union many of the factories that consumed raw materials was closed or sold.
12. Other economic problems include a weak banking system, a poor business climate that discourages investors, corruption, and widespread leak of trust in institutions.
