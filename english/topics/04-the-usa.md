# The USA
1. I would like to tell you about Alaska.
2. Well, Alaska is a state located in the Western United States on the northwest extremity of North America.
3. A semi-exclave of the U.S., it borders the Canadian province of British Columbia and the Yukon territory to the east; it also shares a maritime border with the Russian Federation's Chukotka Autonomous Okrug to the west, just across the Bering Strait.
4. To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas of the Arctic Ocean, while the Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest.
5. Alaska is by far the largest U.S. state by area, comprising more total area than the next three largest states combined.
6. It is the third-least populous and the most sparsely populated state with a population of 736081 as of 2020.
7. While it has one of the smallest state economies in the country, Alaska's per capita income is among the highest, owing to a diversified economy dominated by fishing, natural gas, and oil, all of which it has in abundance.
8. U.S. Armed Forces bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy; more than half the state is federally owned public land, including a multitude of national forests, national parks, and wildlife refuges.
9. The Russian Empire was the first to actively colonize the area beginning in the 18th century, eventually establishing Russian America, which spanned most of the current state.
10. The expense and logistical difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted its sale to the U.S. in 1867 for 7.2 million USD (equivalent to 140 million in 2021).
